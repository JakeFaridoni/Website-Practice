                <li><h1>For Honor</h1><p>
                </br>For Honor is a horrible game. For honor is supposed to be entirely skill-based, the problem with the game is that For Honor is <strong>not</strong> entirely skill-based.
                </br>For Honor is a like a hero shooter if it was placed during medieval times. When the game first launched there were three factions, the Knights, Vikings, and Samurai. Since it's launch many new heroes have been added, inculding two new factions, the Wu-Lin and the Outlanders.
                </br>The combat system is unique, with a directional attacks like the chivalry games, but it also has combination attacks like a 2D-fighting game.</p></li>
